# Health data contract: `wizard.health-data/1`

A **health-data connector** is an app that holds the owner's sign-in to one wearable or health service (WHOOP,
Oura, Garmin, Apple Health...) and offers that data, read-only and normalized, to other apps on the same box.
A **health front end** (the Health app) reads any number of connectors through this contract and never talks to a
provider itself. This mirrors the money stack: Money reads `wizard.bank-connection/1` from SimpleFIN, Monarch or
Teller; Health reads `wizard.health-data/1` from WHOOP and any later connector.

The same file lives in both repos (`wizard-whoop/docs/` and `wizard-health/docs/`). Change both together.

## Discovery

- A connector declares `provides: [health-data, <provider>-health-data]` in `wizard.md`.
- A front end declares `uses: [health-data]`. The App Manager reads that as the `health-data` spot, links the
  front end's network to **every** installed app that provides it, and writes the endpoint it granted into the
  front end's `/wizard/grants.json` (`provider_endpoints`, one per spot; newer App Managers also list every
  provider in `provider_endpoints_all`).
- The front end probes each candidate's `GET /api/status`. A reply with `"contract": "wizard.health-data/1"` is a
  source; the reply names itself (`source.id`, `source.name`, `source.app_path`), so a new connector needs no code
  change in the front end. Candidates come from, in order: `grants.json` `provider_endpoints_all` (every provider
  of the spot: `{"slot:health-data": {"<app id>": "http://<host>:<port>"}}`), `grants.json` `provider_endpoints`
  (one endpoint per spot, what older App Managers write), the `HEALTH_SOURCES` env (`id=http://host:port,...`),
  and the built-in list of known connectors with their ports (`wizard-whoop` 8824, `wizard-oura` 8828,
  `wizard-fitbit` 8830, `wizard-polar` 8832, `wizard-withings` 8834), as Money keeps for bank connections.
  An unreachable candidate is simply "not installed".
- Older App Managers write one endpoint per spot grant. When two connectors fill the spot, the front end still
  reaches both (both networks are linked) through the built-in list or `HEALTH_SOURCES`; App Managers with
  `provider_endpoints_all` need neither.

## Several sources (front end behaviour)

- The owner picks one **main source** when two or more are connected (saved by the front end, server-side). Until
  then the main source is the first connected one in this order: WHOOP, Oura, Fitbit, Polar, Withings, then any
  other.
- Per day the front end uses the main source's record. A metric the main source lacks that day (no `sleep`, no
  `readiness.score`, a `null` number) is taken whole from the first other source that has it, and the front end
  shows where it came from. A readiness the main source marks `pending` is not filled from elsewhere.
- A connector without a readiness score at all says so in its status: `scales.readiness` left out, `null`, or
  `{"label": ..., "available": false}` (a missing `available` means `true`), optionally also
  `"provides": {"readiness": false}`. Its days carry `"readiness": null`. The front end then says it has no score
  from that source (grey), may still show `hrv_ms` and `resting_hr_bpm`, and never derives a score from them.

## Transport and safety

- Plain HTTP on the connector's own port, JSON only, `GET` only for reads.
- Reads are **box-only**: the connector refuses contract reads that arrive through the private-access proxy (any
  `X-Forwarded-For`, `Forwarded`, `X-Real-IP`, `Tailscale-User-Login` or `CF-Connecting-IP` header). The front end
  calls the connector from its own container (`http://<connector-id>:<port>`), scripts call `127.0.0.1:<port>`.
- No reply ever contains keys, tokens, passwords or sign-in codes.
- Errors: `{"error": "<plain sentence>"}` with 400 (bad query), 403 (not box-only), 409 (not connected).

## `GET /api/status`

```json
{
  "contract": "wizard.health-data/1",
  "source": {"id": "wizard-whoop", "provider": "whoop", "name": "WHOOP", "app_path": "/wizard-whoop/"},
  "status": "connected",
  "account": {"name": "Sam"},
  "dataset": "4f0c9a1e2b7d...",
  "last_sync": "2026-10-31T01:02:09.000Z",
  "next_sync": "2026-10-31T01:22:09.000Z",
  "sync_every_minutes": 20,
  "history_from": "2026-03-26",
  "latest_date": "2026-10-31",
  "counts": {"days": 217, "sleeps": 254, "workouts": 122},
  "error": null,
  "scales": {
    "readiness": {"label": "Recovery", "min": 0, "max": 100},
    "sleep_score": {"label": "Sleep performance", "min": 0, "max": 100},
    "load": {"label": "Strain", "min": 0, "max": 21, "scale_max": 21}
  }
}
```

- `status`: `not_configured` (no keys/sign-in yet), `needs_login` (provider ended the sign-in), `syncing`,
  `connected`, `rate_limited` (provider asked to slow down; data still readable). Only `connected`, `syncing`
  and `rate_limited` mean data is flowing.
- `dataset`: an opaque id of the connector's local copy. It changes when the copy is wiped (Disconnect, a new
  account). A front end that sees a different `dataset` drops what it holds from that source and re-reads.
- `scales` tells the front end what to call things and how to draw them. A front end shows `load.label`
  (WHOOP "Strain", Garmin "Training load", Oura "Activity") and never assumes a provider's scale.
- `scales.load` (and every `load` in the days) may carry, additively:
  - `scale_max`: the top of the load scale the front end judges effort on (WHOOP `21`). Without it the front end
    uses `max`. For an open-ended scale (`max: null`, e.g. Active Zone Minutes) it is the top of the drawing scale.
    A front end that sets activity targets from the recovery band takes WHOOP's guidance as fractions of the scale
    (Ready 14/21-18/21, So-so 10/21-14/21, Run down under 10/21 of `scale_max`, "a bit much" up to 3/21 above), so
    WHOOP's own numbers stay 14-18, 10-14 and under 10.
  - `targets`: the provider's own target per readiness band, `{"high": [lo, hi], "medium": [lo, hi], "low": [0, hi]}`
    on the load's own scale. When present the front end uses these instead of the fractions.
  - `over_margin`: how far above a target's top is still "a bit much" (beyond it: "too much"), on the same scale.
    Without it: 3/21 of `scale_max`.
  - `unit`: the short unit of the value (`"min"`). A load with a numeric `max` reads "out of `max`"; an open-ended
    one reads as its `label` ("34 active zone minutes").
  A day's `load` may leave these out when `scales.load` has them; the front end takes them from `scales.load`.
  A load with no `scale_max`, no `max` and no `targets` gets no activity target (no colour), never a guessed one.
- A connector may add its own fields (the WHOOP app adds its setup state); front ends ignore unknown fields.

## `GET /api/days`

Normalized daily records, oldest first, with paging.

Query (all optional):

| name | meaning |
|---|---|
| `from`, `to` | `YYYY-MM-DD`, inclusive, on the record's `date` |
| `changed_since` | a `cursor` from an earlier reply; only days whose data changed after it. Empty string = everything |
| `limit` | days per page, default 100, max 500 |
| `page` | the `next_page` from the previous reply (keep the other query values the same) |

Reply:

```json
{
  "contract": "wizard.health-data/1",
  "source": "wizard-whoop",
  "dataset": "4f0c9a1e2b7d...",
  "days": [ /* day records */ ],
  "next_page": "eyJk...",
  "cursor": "w1.2840"
}
```

- `next_page` is `null` on the last page.
- `cursor` is the connector's change mark at the time of the **first** page of this read (every page repeats
  it). Store it only after the last page, then pass it as `changed_since` next time. Cursors are opaque strings.
- A day is returned again whenever anything in it changes (late scoring, a re-scored sleep, a new workout).
  The day record is always complete, so the front end replaces its copy of that `(source, date)`.

}
```

Rules:

- `date` is the owner's local calendar day the record belongs to (the day he woke up / lived through), as the
  provider defines it.
- Any value the provider did not give is `null`; a section with nothing at all is `null` (`readiness`, `sleep`,
  `load`). Never invent a value.
- `readiness.score` is 0-100. `readiness.band`: `high` (67-100), `medium` (34-66), `low` (0-33) unless the
  provider has its own bands, in which case the provider's band maps onto these three. `readiness.state`:
  `scored`, `pending` (not scored yet), `unscorable`.
- `sleep` is the main sleep that ended on `date`; `sleep.naps` lists shorter sleeps. Hours are decimal hours;
  `asleep_h` excludes awake time. `sleep.score` is the provider's sleep score or performance, 0-100.
- `load` is the day's effort on the provider's own scale; `load.max`, `load.label` and the optional `scale_max`,
  `targets` and `unit` repeat `scales.load`.
- `calories_kcal` is the day's total energy; `energy_kj` is the same in kilojoules when the provider reports kJ.
- `workouts[].zones_min` is minutes in heart-rate zones 0-5 (or `null`).
- `extras` holds provider-specific fields under the provider's own key (`extras.whoop`, `extras.oura`...). Front
  ends may show them but never depend on them.

## Provider mappings

Additive notes: each connector documents here how it maps its provider onto this contract.

### Withings (`wizard-withings`, Withings Public API)

- `date`: Withings' own `date` for sleep summaries (the night's date as Withings files it), daily activity and workouts.
- `readiness` is always `null` and `scales.readiness` is `null`: Withings gives no readiness or recovery score, and the
  connector never makes one up. Health shows "no score" and greys activity matching.
- `sleep` from Sleep v2 - Getsummary: the longest night of the date is the main sleep, others are `naps`;
  `asleep_h` = `total_sleep_time` (or `asleepduration` for nights from an external source, or light + deep + REM);
  `in_bed_h` = `total_timeinbed`; `awake_h` = `wakeupduration`; `efficiency_pct` = `sleep_efficiency` x 100;
  `score` = `sleep_score`; `respiratory_rate` = `rr_average`; `need_h` = `null` (Withings gives no need), so Health
  judges sleep by hours.
- `hrv_ms` = mean of `rmssd_start_avg` and `rmssd_end_avg` (overnight RMSSD); `resting_hr_bpm` = the night's
  `hr_min`. Withings' free developer plan refuses requests that name sleep score, overnight HRV or breathing rate
  (status 277); the connector then asks without them, leaves those values `null`, retries the full set weekly and
  names the withheld fields in `/api/status` `setup.plan_limited`.
- `load`, formula `withings-intensity-minutes/1`: intensity minutes = `moderate` minutes + 2 x `intense` minutes from
  Measure v2 - Getactivity (one vigorous minute counts as two moderate ones). On the source's own open-ended scale:
  `{"label": "Intensity minutes", "max": null, "scale_max": 60, "unit": "min"}`; `scale_max` 60 only sets the
  drawing scale and Health's target fractions. `scales.load.goal` 22 is a hint (about 150 a week). When Withings lists
  several activity sources for one date, the tracker's row is used, else the one with most steps.
- `calories_kcal` = `totalcalories`; `steps`, `avg_hr_bpm`, `max_hr_bpm` from daily activity.
- `workouts`: Measure v2 - Getworkouts; `minutes` = end - start - `pause_duration`; `load` = `null`; `zones_min` =
  `null` (Withings has four zones of its own, kept in `extras.withings.hr_zones_min`).
- `extras.withings`: soft/moderate/intense minutes, active calories, distance, floors, sleep HR average/max, RMSSD start
  and end, sleep latency, wake-ups, WASO, REM episodes, snoring, breathing disturbances, `plan_limited`.

## MCP (connector side)

Connectors expose the same narrow tools so the agent can check them without the front end:
`health_data_status` (the status above), `health_data_sync` (ask for fresh data now) and `health_data_days`
(the `/api/days` read with the same arguments). Owner-facing questions ("how did I sleep?") go to the front end's
tools, not the connector's.

## Versioning

Additive fields keep `wizard.health-data/1`. Renaming or removing a field, or changing a meaning, is
`wizard.health-data/2`; a front end that sees a contract it does not know marks the source "needs an update".
